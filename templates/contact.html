        We are always looking to host more lectures by members of the faculty. If you are a professor at Baruch or
        elsewhere and would like to express interest in giving a presentation with support from the Mathematics
        Society, please let us know by <a href="mailto:mathematicssociety@google.com" target="_top">emailing us</a>.
        The same applies if you are an organization interested in hosting or co-hosting an eventâ€”something we are
        always excited to hear more about!
